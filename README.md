# super-labeler-action

A superpowered issue and pull request labeler for Github Actions.

Super Labeler allows you to declaratively define your repository's labels, and when to apply them, in a config file that's checked into your repository.

## Getting Started

Create a new Github Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/label.yml`:

<details>
  <summary><b>Click to show example workflow</b></summary>

_Note: `actions/checkout` must be run first so that the labeler action can find your config file._

```yaml
on:
  issues: [opened, edited, closed, reopened]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, closed, reopened, ready_for_review, synchronize]

jobs:
  label:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Label issues and pull requests
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: IvanFon/super-labeler-action@v1
        with:
          github-token: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
```

</details>

Now create the labeler config file at `.github/labels.json`:

<details>
  <summary><b>Click here to show example config</b></summary>

```json
{
  "labels": {
    "example": {
      "name": "example",
      "colour": "#00ff00",
      "description": "Example label"
    }
  },
  "issue": {
    "example": {
      "requires": 2,
      "conditions": [
        {
          "type": "titleMatches",
          "pattern": "example"
        },
        {
          "type": "isOpen"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "pr": {
    "example": {
      "requires": 1,
      "conditions": [
        {
          "type": "isDraft",
          "value": false
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

Be sure that Github Actions is enabled for in your repository's settings. Super Labeler will now run on your issues and pull requests.

## How it Works

Whenever Super Labeler runs, it will first add and update your repository's labels to match your config. Then it will go through each label's conditions to determine if it should apply or remove that label.

Each label has a list of conditions that must be met for it to be applied. You must specify the minimum number of conditions that must be met for the label to be applied.

Each label has a key, which can be different from it's name. This key should be in plaintext, and will be used to refer to the given label when defining your conditions. For example, given the following labels definition:

```json
{
  "labels": {
    "bugfix": {
      "name": "Bugfix! ðŸŽ‰",
      "colour": "ff0000",
      "description": "Fixes a bug."
    }
  }
}
```

While the label's name, which will be displayed on Github, is "Bugfix! ðŸŽ‰", to be able to easily refer to it from our conditions, we would use it's key, which is just `bugfix`:

```json
{
  "pr": {
    "bugfix": {
      "requires": 1,
      "conditions": [
        {
          "type": "branchMatches",
          "pattern": "^bugfix"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Config File Format

The config object contains three keys:

- `labels`: Your repository's labels, which will be automatically created and updated by Super Labeler
- `issue`: Labels to apply to issues, and their conditions
- `pr`: Labels to apply to pull requests, and their conditions
- `skip_labeling`: Label name that indicates, that labeling should not be performed. Content is a key of `labels` options

Take a look at the examples in this file to get a feel for how to configure it. The below Typescript interface, which is used by this action, may also be helpful:

<details>
  <summary><b>Click to show Typescript config interface</b></summary>

```ts
interface Config {
  labels: {
    [key: string]: {
      name: string;
      colour: string;
      description: string;
    };
  };
  issue: {
    [key: string]: {
      requires: number;
      conditions: IssueCondition[];
    };
  };
  pr: {
    [key: string]: {
      requires: number;
      conditions: PRCondition[];
    };
  };
  skip_labeling: string;
}
```

## Using Regex Patterns

Many conditions use regular expressions (usually with a `pattern` parameter).
Since these regular expressions are passed in through JSON strings, there are
some things to pay attention to.

Special characters must be double escaped: `pattern: "\\W+$"` is equivalent to the Regex: `/\W+$/`.

If you want to use flags, use the following format: `pattern: "/^wip:/i"` is equivalent to the Regex: `/^wip:/i`.

## Available Conditions

### branchMatches

**Applies to: pull requests**

Checks if branch name matches a Regex pattern.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "branchMatches",
  "pattern": "^bugfix\\/"
}
```

### creatorMatches

**Applies to: issues and pull requests**

Checks if an issue or pull request's creator's username matches a Regex pattern.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "creatorMatches",
  "pattern": "^foo"
}
```

### descriptionMatches

**Applies to: issues and pull requests**

Checks if an issue or pull request's description matches a Regex pattern.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "descriptionMatches",
  "pattern": "foo.*bar"
}
```

### filesMatch

**Applies to: pull requests**

Checks if the files modified in the pull request match a glob.

Globs are matched using the [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) library.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "filesMatch",
  "glob": "src/foo/**/*"
}
```

### isDraft

**Applies to: pull requests**

Checks if a pull request is a draft.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "isDraft",
  "value": true
}
```

### isLocked

**Applies to: issues and pull requests**

Checks if an issue or pull request is locked.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "isLocked",
  "value": true
}
```

### isOpen

**Applies to: issues and pull requests**

Checks if an issue or pull request is open or closed.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "isOpen",
  "value": true
}
```

### titleMatches

**Applies to: issues and pull requests**

Checks if an issue or pull request's title matches a Regex pattern.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "titleMatches",
  "pattern": "/^wip:/i"
}
```
