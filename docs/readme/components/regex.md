### Using Regex Patterns

Many conditions use regular expressions (usually with a `pattern` parameter).
Since these regular expressions are passed in through JSON strings, there are
some things to pay attention to.

Special characters must be double escaped: `pattern: "\\W+$"` is equivalent to the Regex: `/\W+$/`.

If you want to use flags, use the following format: `pattern: "/^wip:/i"` is equivalent to the Regex: `/^wip:/i`.
