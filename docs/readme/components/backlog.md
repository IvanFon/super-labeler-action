## Backlog & Contributing

Thank you for taking an interst in contributing. We have created development containers (`.devcontainer`) to allow you to jump straight in with coding. We even went through the hassle of setting up step by step guides using [CodeTour](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/codetour). Everything is configured and ready to go, all you need to do is use one of the supported platforms: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) | [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

For more information on how to contribute, please read the [contributing guidelines](docs/contributing/README.md).

Our backlog can be found on [Github](https://github.com/Videndum/action-masterminds/projects/1)
