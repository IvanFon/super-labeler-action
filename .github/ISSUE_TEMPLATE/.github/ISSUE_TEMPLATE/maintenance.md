## Improvements

<!-- Explain the benefits of this maintenance.

Transparent changes have the reasons for the change laid out clearly along with the change itself. This leads to fewer questions later on because people already have some understanding. A change with no public explanation can lead to a lot of extra rounds of questioning, which is less efficient. Avoid using terms such as "industry standard" or "best practices" as they are vague, opaque, and don't provide enough context as a reason for a change. -->

## Expected risks

<!-- Please list features that can break because of this maintenance and how you intend to solve that. -->

## Involved components

<!-- List files or directories that will be changed by the maintenance. -->
